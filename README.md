# Election Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit 

### The purpose of this analysis was to add more information to the election analysis and provide more information for Seth and Tom. Our goal was to find the voter turnout for each county, the percentage of votes from each county, and ultimately discover the county that had the highest turnout. 

## Election Audit Results

### I was unable to figure out how to get the desired results that Seth and Tom were looking to add, but based on the table given in the challenge the county with the largest turnout was Denver, accounting for 82.8% of the total votes. 

## Election Audit Summary 

### Diana Degette was the overall winner of the election by receiving 272,892 votes which accounted for 73.8% of the total votes.
